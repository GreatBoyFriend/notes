The code in drivers/pwm and include/linux/pwm/ implements an API for
applications involving pulse-width-modulation signals.  This document
describes how the API implementation facilitates both PWM-generating
devices, and users of those devices.


Motivation

The primary goals for implementing the "generic PWM API" are to
consolidate the various PWM implementations within a consistent and
redundancy-reducing framework, and to facilitate the use of
hotpluggable PWM devices.

Previous PWM-related implementations within the Linux kernel achieved
their consistency via cut-and-paste, but did not need to (and didn't)
facilitate more than one PWM-generating device within the system---
hotplug or otherwise.  The Generic PWM Device API might be most
appropriately viewed as an update to those implementations, rather
than a complete rewrite.


Challenges

One of the difficulties in implementing a generic PWM framework is the
fact that pulse-width-modulation applications involve real-world
signals, which often must be carefully managed to prevent destruction
of hardware that is linked to those signals.  A DC motor that
experiences a brief interruption in the PWM signal controlling it
might destructively overheat; it could suddenly change speed, losing
synchronization with a sensor; it could even suddenly change direction
or torque, breaking the mechanical device connected to it.

(A generic PWM device framework is not directly responsible for
preventing the above scenarios: that responsibility lies with the
hardware designer, and the application and driver authors.  But it
must to the greatest extent possible make it easy to avoid such
problems).

A generic PWM device framework must accommodate the substantial
differences between available PWM-generating hardware devices, without
becoming sub-optimal for any of them.

Finally, a generic PWM device framework must be relatively
lightweight, computationally speaking.  Some PWM users demand
high-speed outputs, plus the ability to regulate those outputs
quickly.  A device framework must be able to "keep up" with such
hardware, while still leaving time to do real work.

The Generic PWM Device API is an attempt to meet all of the above
requirements.  At its initial publication, the API was already in use
managing small DC motors, sensors and solenoids through a
custom-designed, optically-isolated H-bridge driver.


Functional Overview

The Generic PWM Device API framework is implemented in
include/linux/pwm/pwm.h and drivers/pwm/pwm.c.  The functions therein
use information from pwm_device and pwm_config structures to invoke
services in PWM peripheral device drivers.  Consult
drivers/pwm/atmel-pwmc.c for an example driver for the Atmel PWMC
peripheral.

There are two classes of adopters of the PWM framework:

  Users -- those wishing to employ the API merely to produce PWM
  signals; once they have identified the appropriate physical output
  on the platform in question, they don't care about the details of
  the underlying hardware

  Driver authors -- those wishing to bind devices that can generate
  PWM signals to the Generic PWM Device API, so that the services of
  those devices become available to users. Assuming the hardware can
  support the needs of a user, driver authors don't care about the
  details of the user's application

Generally speaking, users will first invoke pwm_request() to obtain a
handle to a PWM device.  They will then pass that handle to functions
like pwm_duty_ns() and pwm_period_ns() to set the duty cycle and
period of the PWM signal, respectively.  They will also invoke
pwm_start() and pwm_stop() to turn the signal on and off.

The Generic PWM API framework also provides a sysfs interface to PWM
devices, which is adequate for basic application needs and testing.

Driver authors fill out a pwm_device_ops structure, which describes
the capabilities of the PWM hardware being utilized.  They then invoke
pwm_register() (usually from within their device's probe() handler) to
make the PWM API aware of their device.  The framework will call back
to the methods described in the pwm_device_ops structure as users
begin to configure and utilize the hardware.

Many PWM-capable peripherals provide two, three, or more channels of
PWM output.  The driver author calls pwm_register() once for each
channel they wish to be supported by the Generic PWM API.

Note that PWM signals can be produced by a variety of peripherals,
beyond the true PWM peripherals offered by many system-on-chip
devices.  Other possibilities include timer/counters with
compare-match capabilities, carefully-programmed synchronous serial
ports (e.g. SPI), and GPIO pins driven by kernel interval timers.
With a proper pwm_device structure, these devices and pseudo-devices
can be accommodated by the Generic PWM Device API framework.

The following paragraphs describe the basic functions provided by the
Generic PWM API framework.  See the kerneldoc in drivers/pwm/pwm.c for
the most detailed documentation.


Using the API to Generate PWM Signals -- Basic Kernel Functions

pwm_request() -- Returns a pwm_device pointer, which is subsequently
passed to the other user-related PWM functions.  Once requested, a PWM
channel is marked as in-use and subsequent requests prior to
pwm_release() will fail.

The names used to refer to PWM devices are defined by driver authors.
Typically they are platform device bus identifiers, and this
convention is encouraged for consistency.

pwm_release() -- Marks a PWM channel as no longer in use.  The PWM
device is stopped before it is released by the API.

pwm_period_ns() -- Specifies the PWM signal's period, in nanoseconds.

pwm_duty_ns() -- Specifies the PWM signal's active duration, in nanoseconds.

pwm_duty_percent() -- Specifies the PWM signal's active duration, as a
percentage of the current period of the signal.  NOTE: this value is
not recalculated if the period of the signal is subsequently changed.

pwm_start(), pwm_stop() -- Turns the PWM signal on and off.  Except
where stated otherwise by a driver author, signals are stopped at the
end of the current period, at which time the output is set to its
inactive state.

pwm_polarity() -- Defines whether the PWM signal output's active
region is "1" or "0".  A 10% duty-cycle, polarity=1 signal will
conventionally be at 5V (or 3.3V, or 1000V, or whatever the platform
hardware does) for 10% of the period.  The same configuration of a
polarity=0 signal will be at 5V (or 3.3V, or ...) for 90% of the
period.


Using the Sysfs Interface to Generate PWM Signals from Userspace

The Generic PWM API provides the following attributes under
/sys/class/pwm/<device>/ to allow user applications to control
and/or monitor PWM signal generation.  Except for the 'export'
attribute, all attributes are read-only if the PWM device is not
exported to userspace.

export (rw) -- write a label to this attribute to request that the PWM
device be exported to userspace; returns the length of the label on
success (for compatibilty with echo/cat), or -EBUSY if the device is
already in use by the kernel or has already been exported to
userspace. Read from this attribute to obtain the label of the current
PWM device owner, if any.

unexport (w) -- write a non-null string to this attribute to release
the PWM device; the device then becomes available for reexport and/or
requests.  Returns -EBUSY if the device is not currently exported,
-EINVAL if the device is not currently in use, or the length of the
string on success.

polarity (rw) -- write an ascii '1' to set active high, or a '0' for
active low.  Read to obtain the current polarity.

period_ns (rw) -- write an ascii decimal number to set the period of
the PWM device, in nanoseconds.  Value written must not be less than
duty_ns or -EINVAL is returned.  Read to determine the current period
of the PWM device, which might be slightly different than the value
requested due to hardware limitations.

duty_ns (rw) -- write an ascii decimal number to set the duration of
the active portion of the PWM period, in nanoseconds; value written
must not exceed period_ns.  Read to obtain current duty_ns, which may
be slightly different than the value requested due to hardware
limitations.

tick_hz (r) -- indicates the base tick rate of the underlying
hardware, in nanoseconds.  Returns '0' if the rate is not yet known,
which might be the case if the device has not been requested yet (some
drivers don't initialize this value until the hardware is requested,
because the value is dynamic).

run (rw) -- write '1' to start PWM signal generation, '0' to stop.
Read to determine whether the PWM device is running or not.


Using the API to Generate PWM Signals -- Advanced Functions

pwm_config() -- Passes a pwm_config structure to the associated device
driver.  This function is invoked by pwm_start(), pwm_duty_ns(),
etc. and is one of two main entry points to the PWM driver for the
hardware being used.  The configuration change is guaranteed atomic if
multiple configuration changes are specified by the config structure.
This function might sleep, depending on what the device driver has to
do to satisfy the request.  All PWM device drivers must support this
entry point.

pwm_config_nosleep() -- Passes a pwm_config structure to the
associated device driver.  If the driver must sleep in order to
implement the requested configuration change, -EWOULDBLOCK is
returned.  Users may call this function from interrupt handlers, timer
handlers, and other interrupt contexts, but must confine their
configuration changes to only those that the driver can implement
without sleeping.  This is the other main entry point into the PWM
hardware driver, but not all device drivers support this entry point.

pwm_synchronize(), pwm_unsynchronize() -- "Synchronizes" two or more
PWM channels, if the underlying hardware permits.  (If it doesn't, the
framework facilitates emulating this capability but it is not yet
implemented).  Synchronized channels will start and stop
simultaneously when any single channel in the group is started or
stopped.  Use pwm_unsynchronize(..., NULL) to completely detach a
channel from any other synchronized channels.  By default, all PWM
channels are unsynchronized.


Implementing a PWM Device API Driver -- Functions for Driver Authors


request -- (optional) Invoked each time a user requests a channel.
Use to turn on clocks, clean up register states, etc.  The framework
takes care of device locking/unlocking; you will see only successful
requests.

release -- (optional) Invoked each time a user relinquishes a channel.
The framework will have already stopped, unsynchronized and un-handled
the channel.  Use to turn off clocks, etc. as necessary.

config -- Invoked to change the device configuration, always from a
sleep-compatible context.  All the changes indicated must be performed
atomically, ideally synchronized to an end-of-period event (so that
you avoid short or long output pulses).  You may sleep, etc. as
necessary within this function.

config_nosleep -- (optional) Invoked to change device configuration
from within a context that is not allowed to sleep.  If you cannot
perform the requested configuration changes without sleeping, return
-EWOULDBLOCK.


FAQs and Additional Notes

The Atmel PWMC pwm_config() function tries to satisfy the user's
configuration request by first invoking pwm_config_nosleep().  If that
operation fails, then the PWM peripheral is brought to a synchronized
stop, the configuration changes are made, and the device is restarted.

The Atmel PWMC's use of pwm_config_nosleep() from pwm_config()
minimizes redundant code between the two functions, and relieves the
pwm_config() function of the need to explicitly test whether a
requested configuration change can be carried out while the PWM device
is in its current mode.

PWM API driver authors are encouraged to adopt the Atmel PWMC's
pwm_config()-vs.-pwm_config_nosleep() strategy in implementations for
other devices as well.
